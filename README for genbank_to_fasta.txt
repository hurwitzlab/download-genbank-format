Installation Instructions:

1)Make sure you have a working version of Biopython installed. This software was
developed on version 1.54, though later versions should work. It can be found
at: http://biopython.org/.

2)Adjust the first line of the genbank_to_fasta.py file to point to your
system's python binary. If you don't know where it is, type 'which python' into
the command line.

3)Move the genbank_to_fasta.py file to an executable directory. On many systems,
it is /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/bin/.

4)From the command line type 'genbank_to_fasta.py -h' for usage information.
